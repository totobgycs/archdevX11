# archdevX11
Archlinux image to run GUI programs (like Eclipse, etc). Based on [totobgycs/archdev](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/totobgycs/archdev/). 
It defines a the user guiuser to be used as login user in derived images rather dan root or build. This image is intended as 
base image to derive gui images, so the last user in the image is build.
